The webiste __IFTA FILING__ keeps track of the _IFTA Taxes_ for trucking business.

The plans (subscriptions) are meant for small to professional business, and so they are available for the owners of trucks and not for the drivers (the drivers can have free accounts but cannot register records)

### How does subscriptions work?

The owner of the truck buys the subscription, as the _IFTA Taxes_ depends on the data from the truck and not of the driver, each subscription has a maximum limit of both trucks and drivers. Hence, a driver can register a new record for a truck if and only if the owner's subscription is valid.

__NOTE:__ A driver can work for several owners and can drive several trucks.
